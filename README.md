## About me

Welcome to my Portfolio!

Based in Seattle, I'm a full-stack developer known for precision and innovative thinking. Beyond the code, you'll find me capturing the essence of cars through photography, diving into digital art, or on caravan cruises. Every experience, whether in life or development, is a lesson in problem-solving for me.
My roots trace back to Santa Ana, CA, a place that instilled in me grit and determination. I've worn many hatsâ€”from a Dock Foreman at Behr Paint to an entrepreneurial force in the car scene. Software development? Just another exciting chapter in my story of adaptability.
I appreciate your time in exploring my work I hope I get to hear from you.
